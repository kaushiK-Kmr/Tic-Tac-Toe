# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game usually played with pen and paper. It requires two players, where one has to choose either 'X' or 'O' to start the game. Both players place their signs on their turns by using mouse right-click and try their best moves. As soon a player wins, the game is over with message about who wins. User can also see the winning move.
To see the Winning Move, user can just scroll down to the bottom of the page.

START A NEW GAME : To start a new game after, just click on the NEW GAME button. The game will start by giving the player who lost the previous match, the chance to play first.
RESET THE GAME   : If the players want to reset the match from beginning, just press the "RESET" button to restart from the beginning.

Working of the Game :

The game works on the same principle that is used while playing it on paper and pen. The only way to win is to place three same signs in a straight line, either diagonally or horizontally or vertically. Whoever places them first will be the winner.
There is no undo option for the players for a fair game.
